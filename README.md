# Music production and sound design

[Ruki](https://github.com/ItsShamed) will design SFX and OST using
FL Studio 20 (All Bundle Edition). No special VST plugins are required 
so far. A legitimate copy of FL Studio and other plugins are used. Ff
you wish to contribute, we encourage to buy a legitimate copy of the
tools you will be using, or use free software.
